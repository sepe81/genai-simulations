# GenAI Simulations

Interactive physics simulations and creative coding experiments built with Matter.js and modern web technologies.

## 🎈 Simulations

### Balloon Pop
**[balloon_pop.html](balloon_pop.html)**

Interactive balloon popping game with realistic physics and 3D-styled balloons. Control a syringe with your mouse to pop colorful floating balloons—each pop creates a shockwave that pushes nearby balloons.

**Features:**
- Realistic 3D balloon rendering with gradients and shine effects
- Physics-based shock waves that affect nearby balloons
- Dynamic sound effects (pitch varies by balloon size)
- Smooth syringe rotation following mouse movement
- Score tracking and auto-reset

**Tech:** Matter.js, Web Audio API, Canvas 2D

**How to run:** Simply open `balloon_pop.html` in your browser. No build process or dependencies needed!

## 🚀 Getting Started

All simulations are self-contained HTML files. To run:

1. Clone this repository
2. Open any `.html` file in your web browser
3. That's it!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sepe81/genai-simulations.git
cd genai-simulations
open balloon_pop.html  # macOS
# or just double-click the file
```

## 🛠️ Technologies

- **Matter.js** – 2D physics engine for realistic interactions
