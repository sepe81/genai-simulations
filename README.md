# GenAI Simulations

Interactive physics simulations and creative coding experiments built with Matter.js and modern web technologies.

## 🎈 Simulations

### Balloon Pop

**[balloon_pop.html](balloon_pop.html)**

Interactive balloon popping game with realistic physics and 3D-styled balloons. Control a syringe with your mouse to pop colorful floating balloons—each pop creates a shockwave that pushes nearby balloons.

**Features:**

- Realistic 3D balloon rendering with gradients and shine effects
- Physics-based shock waves that affect nearby balloons
- Dynamic sound effects (pitch varies by balloon size)
- Smooth syringe rotation following mouse movement
- Score tracking and auto-reset

**Tech:** Matter.js, Web Audio API, Canvas 2D

**How to run:** Simply open `balloon_pop.html` in your browser. No build process or dependencies needed!

### Nerf Gun Shooting Gallery

**[nerf_gun_demo.html](nerf_gun_demo.html)**

Interactive shooting gallery with two game modes: precision target shooting and physics-based tower destruction. Aim with your mouse (vertical movement controls angle) and fire foam darts at targets or knock down colorful block towers.

**Features:**

- Mouse-controlled aiming with smooth rotation (-20° to +40°)
- Two game modes: Target Practice and Tower Destruction
- Three different Nerf gun models to choose from
- Physics-based recoil that follows gun rotation
- Scoring system for target mode
- Matter.js powered tower physics with realistic block collapse
- Dynamic projectile behavior based on aim angle

**Tech:** Matter.js, SVG Graphics, Web Audio API, Canvas 2D

**How to run:** Simply open `nerf_gun_demo.html` in your browser. No build process or dependencies needed!
